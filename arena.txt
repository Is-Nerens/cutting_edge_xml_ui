Add_Text() -> 
- find the first fit space in the text arena and copy the characters, if no fits -> resize character buffer

Update_Text()
- > if new text length < existing length -> overwrite existing text and update the char_count, if new text size is > text ref capacity, free region and call Add_Text()

Delete_Text()
-> update the free list and merge adjacent blocks
-> remove text reference element and 

Sort_Free_List() -> expensive to call, but improves insertion speed subsequently
